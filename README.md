# StreamAggSync-master

## Introduction
StreamAggSync-master is an event-driven data processing system designed to interact in real-time with an online banking platform. This system consumes data from Kafka topics generated during the simulation of banking events within the banking environment. It leverages Spark Structured Streaming for efficient consumption of Kafka messages, intelligent aggregation, and storage of aggregated data in PostgreSQL databases. The project aims to facilitate real-time analysis and reliable storage of data from various Kafka topics, specifically within the domain of Banking Regulation and Risk Management.

## Functional Requirements
- **Kafka Message Consumption**:
  - Reliably and efficiently consume messages from multiple Kafka topics in real-time.

- **Data Aggregation**:
  - Aggregate consumed data in real-time based on predefined rules (e.g., statistical calculations, averages, sums) tailored to analysis requirements.

- **Storage of Aggregated Data**:
  - Persist aggregated data in designated PostgreSQL databases for organized and accessible storage.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **High Performance**:
  - Handle large volumes of data and a high number of Kafka messages in real-time to ensure responsive analysis and quick decision-making.

- **Scalability**:
  - Designed to easily accommodate additional Kafka topics for consumption and new databases for storing aggregated data without major architectural changes.

- **Fault Tolerance**:
  - Tolerant to hardware or software failures, capable of resuming processing from the point of interruption without significant data loss.

## System Components
- **Banking Platform**:
  - Simulates a banking environment, generating simulated banking events and data. It transforms these events into Kafka messages and sends them to appropriate Kafka topics, serving as the data source for the system.

- **Data Processing Engine**:
  - Core component responsible for data consumption and aggregation. It encompasses the Kafka consumer and aggregator functionalities using Spark Structured Streaming:
    - **Kafka Consumer**: Implemented using Spark Structured Streaming to continuously consume messages from specified Kafka topics.
    - **Aggregator**: Real-time aggregation engine implemented using Spark Structured Streaming. This component intelligently aggregates data consumed from Kafka topics based on predefined rules.

- **PostgreSQL Databases**:
  - Storage components where aggregated data is persisted. Multiple databases may be used to store aggregated data in an organized and accessible manner.

- **Web Interface**:
  - Thymeleaf-based web interface serving as the user interface for interacting with aggregated results stored in the database. It provides user-friendly visualization of aggregated data and supports real-time updates via AJAX calls triggering periodic data refreshes.

## Data Flow and Interaction
The system follows a well-defined data flow and interaction process, comprising several essential steps for banking data processing, aggregation, and storage:
1. **Data Generation - Banking Platform**:
   - Data flow begins with the Banking Platform, which generates simulated banking events and data. This data is essential for banking operations and customer interactions. The Banking Platform acts as Kafka producers, sending messages into Kafka topics.

2. **Data Consumption - Data Processing Engine**:
   - The Data Processing Engine acts as the Kafka consumer. It connects to relevant Kafka topics and retrieves messages emitted by the Banking Platform.

3. **Data Extraction Schemas**:
   - Specific extraction schemas are applied to extract relevant data from Kafka messages. These schemas, tailored to message structure, identify and extract crucial fields and information necessary for subsequent aggregation.

4. **Data Aggregation - Data Processing Engine**:
   - The Data Processing Engine aggregates data based on analysis requirements in real-time. Aggregation is a critical step to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

5. **Data Storage**:
   - Aggregated data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. This database is designed to handle large data volumes and meet data analysis and regulatory compliance needs. It involves inserting or updating records based on the defined data structure.

6. **Web-based Interface**:
   - The Thymeleaf-based web interface reads data from the database and displays it in a user-friendly format. It supports real-time updates, allowing users to analyze aggregated results based on their requirements.

In summary, the data flow is continuous, starting with data generation in the Banking Platform, transitioning into Kafka message transformation, consumption by the Kafka consumer, real-time data aggregation, persistent storage in databases, and finally, visualization of aggregated data through a user-friendly web interface. This process forms a cycle where data is processed in real-time, enabling continuous analysis of data streams to address regulatory and risk management needs in the banking domain.
